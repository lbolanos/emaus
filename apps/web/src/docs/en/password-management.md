# Password Management

This section explains how to change your password or set up a new password if you registered with Google.

## Overview

The password management section allows you to keep your account secure by periodically changing your password. If you registered using your Google account, you can also set up a password to sign in with your email and password.

## Changing Password

If you already have a password set up, you can change it by following these steps:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Change Password**
2. Enter your **current password**
3. Enter your **new password** (minimum 8 characters)
4. **Confirm** your new password
5. Click **Change Password**

### Password Requirements

Your new password must meet the following requirements:

- **Minimum length:** 8 characters
- **Different from current:** New password must be different from your current password
- **Confirmation:** Both passwords must match

## Setting Up Password (Google Users)

If you registered using your Google account, you don't initially have a password configured. To set up a password:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Change Password**
2. You'll notice the **current password** field doesn't appear
3. Enter your **new password** (minimum 8 characters)
4. **Confirm** your new password
5. Click **Set Password**

Once you've set up your password, you can sign in using:
- Your Google account (as before)
- Your email address and the password you set up

## Benefits of Setting Up a Password

Setting up a password as a Google user provides you with:

- **Sign-in flexibility:** You can choose between signing in with Google or with your email and password
- **Alternative access:** If you have issues with your Google account, you can still access the system
- **Independence:** You don't exclusively rely on Google to access the system

## Password Security

### Tips for Creating a Secure Password

- Use a combination of letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols
- Avoid using personal information like birthdays or names
- Don't use the same password you use on other sites
- Consider using a passphrase (a long phrase with spaces)

### When to Change Your Password

It's recommended to change your password:

- Immediately if you suspect someone else knows it
- Every 3-6 months to maintain security
- After using a public computer or network
- If you accidentally shared your password with someone

## Password Recovery

If you forgot your password, you can reset it:

1. On the sign-in screen, click **Forgot Password?**
2. Enter your email address
3. Check your inbox and follow the instructions
4. Create a new secure password
