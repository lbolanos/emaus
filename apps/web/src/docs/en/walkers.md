# Managing Walkers

This section explains how to manage walkers (caminantes) - retreat participants who will be attending the retreat.

## Overview

Walkers are the core participants of the retreat. The system tracks comprehensive information about each walker including:

- Personal information (name, email, phone)
- Emergency contacts
- Family/friend relationships (with color coding)
- Special considerations (snoring, dietary needs, etc.)
- Payment status

## Adding a Walker

To add a new walker:

1. Navigate to **Walkers** in the sidebar
2. Click the **Add Walker** button
3. Fill in the required information:
   - First and last name
   - Contact information
   - Emergency contact
4. Click **Save** to add the walker

## Importing Walkers

You can import multiple walkers from an Excel file:

1. Click the **Import** button
2. Select your Excel file
3. Map the columns to system fields
4. Review and confirm the import

## Editing Walker Information

1. Find the walker in the list using the search or filters
2. Click on the walker's row to open their details
3. Click **Edit** to modify information
4. Save your changes

## Deleting Walkers

Walkers are never permanently deleted. Instead, they are marked as "deleted" to maintain data integrity:

1. Open the walker's details
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm the action

The walker will no longer appear in active lists but remains in the database.

## Color Coding

Family members and friends can be assigned matching colors to help with grouping during table and room assignments.

## Filters

Use the available filters to quickly find specific walkers:

- Search by name or email
- Filter by status (active, deleted)
- Filter by payment status
- Filter by assigned status
