# Bed Assignments

This section explains how to manage room and bed assignments for retreat participants.

## Overview

The bed assignment system tracks where each participant will sleep during the retreat. It considers:

- Room locations (floor, wing)
- Bed types (normal, bunk, mattress)
- Participant age (younger participants get bunks/lower floors)
- Special needs (snoring, accessibility)
- Walker vs server assignments

## Bed Types

- **Normal**: Standard bed (single or double)
- **Bunk**: Bunk bed (top or bottom)
- **Mattress**: Floor mattress or rollaway

## Room Assignment Workflow

### Step 1: Review House Configuration

1. Navigate to **Bed Assignments**
2. Review available rooms and beds
3. Check bed types and locations

### Step 2: Assign by Priority

Assign rooms in this order:

1. **Special Needs First**: Participants with accessibility needs
2. **Leaders**: Table leaders and co-leaders
3. **Older Walkers**: Participants over 50 get lower-floor regular beds
4. **Younger Walkers**: Participants under 30 may get bunks
5. **Remaining Participants**: Fill remaining beds

### Step 3: Consider Snoring

The system tracks snoring information:

- Group confirmed snorers together when possible
- Separate light sleepers from heavy snorers
- Note: Bed assignments may need adjustment based on snoring reports

### Step 4: Family Considerations

- Family members are generally NOT roomed together
- This allows for the retreat experience
- Exceptions may be made for medical needs
