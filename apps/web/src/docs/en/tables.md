# Table Assignments

This section explains how to manage table assignments for retreat participants.

## Overview

Tables are small groups where walkers process their retreat experience together. Each table typically has:

- **1 Leader (Líder)**: The main facilitator
- **1-2 Co-leaders (Colíderes)**: Assistant facilitators
- **6-10 Walkers (Caminantes)**: Retreat participants

## Creating Tables

1. Navigate to **Tables** in the sidebar
2. Click **Add Table**
3. Assign leaders:
   - Select a leader (líder)
   - Select co-leaders (colíder1, colíder2)
4. Add walkers to the table
5. Save the table

## Table Assignment Rules

- Each table must have at least one leader
- Family members should not be at the same table
- Consider walker compatibility when assigning
- Tables typically have 8-10 people total

## Drag and Drop Assignment

You can use drag and drop to assign walkers:

1. Click and hold on a walker's name
2. Drag them to the desired table
3. Release to assign

The system will warn you if:

- A family member is already at that table
- The table is at maximum capacity

## Managing Table Composition

### Reassigning Walkers

1. Open the table details
2. Click **Edit**
3. Remove walker from current table
4. Add them to a different table
5. Save changes

### Reassigning Leaders

Leaders can be reassigned the same way as walkers. Just drag them to a new table or use the edit interface.
