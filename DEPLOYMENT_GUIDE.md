# Emaus Deployment Guide 🎯

Your Emaus Retreat Management System is now **fully production-ready**! Choose the deployment method that fits your workflow.

## 🚀 Deployment Methods

### Option 1: Pre-built Local Deploy (Recommended for $5 VPS) 🏠
**Build locally, deploy built artifacts - No VPS memory issues**

```bash
# Set your VPS connection details
export VPS_HOST=your-vps-ip
export VPS_USER=root

# Run the deployment
./build-locally-deploy.sh
```

**✅ Advantages:**
- Builds on your powerful local machine
- Very fast deployment (seconds)
- Works with $5/month VPS
- Most reliable for memory-constrained servers

### Option 2: GitHub Releases 🚀
**Download pre-built binaries from GitHub**

```bash
# First, create a release (see below)
# Then on your VPS:
export GITHUB_REPO=lbolanos/emaus
export RELEASE_TAG=v1.0.0

./release-from-github.sh
```

**✅ Advantages:**
- No build tools needed on VPS
- Version management through GitHub
- CDN-fast downloads
- Easy rollback to previous versions

### Option 3: Direct VPS Build ⚡
**Build directly on VPS (requires more memory)**

```bash
# Only works with $10+ VPS or added swap
./deploy-vultr.sh
```

## 📋 Complete Setup Instructions

### Step 1: VPS Preparation

```bash
# Connect to your VPS
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP

# Run initial setup (works on Ubuntu, AlmaLinux, Rocky, Alpine, FreeBSD, OpenBSD)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbolanos/emaus/master/setup-vultr.sh | bash
```

### Step 2: Choose Deployment Method

#### Method A: Pre-built Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# On your LOCAL machine
export VPS_HOST=your-vps-ip
export VPS_USER=root
./build-locally-deploy.sh
```

#### Method B: GitHub Release Deployment
```bash
# First, create a release (see "Creating Releases" below)
# Then on your VPS:
export GITHUB_REPO=lbolanos/emaus
export RELEASE_TAG=v1.0.0
./release-from-github.sh
```

### Step 3: SSL Setup (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
export domain_name=yourdomain.com
./ssl-setup.sh
```

## 🏷️ Creating GitHub Releases

### Automated Release Process

1. **Push a version tag to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions will automatically:**
   - Build your application
   - Create `web-dist.tar.gz` (frontend)
   - Create `api-dist.tar.gz` (backend)
   - Attach to GitHub release

3. **Deploy from VPS:**
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_REPO=yourusername/emaus
   export RELEASE_TAG=v1.0.0
   ./release-from-github.sh
   ```

### Manual Release Process

```bash
# Build locally
pnpm build

# Create archives
cd apps/web/dist && tar -czf ../../../web-dist.tar.gz .
cd ../../../apps/api/dist && tar -czf ../../../api-dist.tar.gz .

# Upload to GitHub release manually
```

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

**API (.env):**
```bash
DB_TYPE=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=database.sqlite
SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-here
FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com
NODE_ENV=production
```

**Web (.env):**
```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://yourdomain.com/api
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

### Updating Environment Variables

```bash
# On VPS, edit the files:
nano apps/api/.env
nano apps/web/.env

# Restart services
pm2 restart ecosystem.config.js
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

---

## 🔧 Maintenance Commands

### Check Services
```bash
pm2 status              # App status
sudo systemctl status nginx    # Web server
sudo systemctl status postgresql  # Database (if used)
```

### Logs
```bash
pm2 logs               # App logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/emaus-access.log  # Web logs
```

### Updates
```bash

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Restart services
pm2 restart all
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Database Backup
```bash
./backup-db.sh
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Memory Issues
**Problem:** "FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit"
**Solution:** Use pre-built deployment methods (Option 1 or 2)

### App Won't Start
```bash
pm2 logs emaus-api
# Check for database connection errors
```

### Web App Shows API Errors
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
# Check if API is responding
```

### SSL Issues
